# Random Mixins for GTNH

I write this mod to learn mixin.

This mod removes things I dislike. So it's called "My GTNH".

Any changes can be disabled in `config/mygtnh.cfg`

### Features

 - gc_armor: Used to remove the ugly thermal clothes rendering.
 - gg_meme: Used to remove memes I dislike.
 - warp_eff: Used to remove thaumcraft/warptheory effect but keep warp point.
 - gt_pollute: Used to remove Pollution rendering on client.
 - tank_debuff: Used to remove GT SuperTank debuff.
